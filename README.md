# Particle Swarm Optimiser for Artificial Neural Nets

This project implements a basic Artificial Neural Network from scratch without the use of machine learning libraries. It then uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to train the weights and bias of the network.

## Features

* The task of the network is function approximation
* The network does not implement any classical training algorithm such as backpropegation since the training is done by PSO
* The program outputs graphical representations of the predicted function against their actual data
